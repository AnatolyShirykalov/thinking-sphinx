## Installing Thinking Sphinx (Rails 3.1 or Newer)

<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: Thinking Sphinx v3.x (as documented here) is written for Ruby 1.9. If you are using Ruby 1.8.7 (or equivalent), please use a v2 release - covered in <a href="/thinking-sphinx/installing_thinking_sphinx/ts2.html">the Rails 3.0 installation instructions</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: Thinking Sphinx v3 is a complete rewrite from previous versions, and there are many small and big changes. These are noted accordingly in this documentation.</p>
</div>

If you're using Rails 3.1+ (including 4.x and 5.x), then you should use the version 3 releases of Thinking Sphinx. If you're using MRI, you'll also need the mysql2 gem 0.3.13 or newer for connecting to Sphinx. If you're using JRuby, you'll need the jdbc-mysql gem (and Sphinx 2.1.2 or newer). Even if you're using **PostgreSQL**, you will _still_ need to have the mysql2 gem installed (along with the pg gem too, of course).

Install them like you would any other gem - either manually:

{% highlight sh %}
gem install thinking-sphinx -v "~> 3.4.2"
gem install mysql2 -v ">= 0.3.18"
# or, for JRuby:
gem install jdbc-mysql -v 5.1.35
{% endhighlight %}

Or by adding them to your Gemfile:

{% highlight ruby %}
gem 'mysql2',          '>= 0.3.18', :platform => :ruby
gem 'jdbc-mysql',      '= 5.1.35',  :platform => :jruby
gem 'thinking-sphinx', '~> 3.4.2'
{% endhighlight %}

Versions of `jdbc-mysql` after 5.1.35 have altered behaviour that is not compatible with Sphinx.

You can also refer directly to the git repository - but if you're doing this, specifying the version, branch and commit reference is recommended so when you next go to upgrade the gem, it's clear what you were using (and perhaps why). The `develop` branch is where commits are pushed between version releases. The `master` branch is only updated when a new version is released.

{% highlight ruby %}
gem 'mysql2',          '~> 0.3.18', :platform => :ruby
gem 'jdbc-mysql',      '= 5.1.35',  :platform => :jruby
gem 'thinking-sphinx', '~> 3.2.0',
  :git    => 'git://github.com/pat/thinking-sphinx.git',
  :branch => 'develop',
  :ref    => 'cb45e1b1bf'
{% endhighlight %}

At the time of writing this, Rails 4 is supported by Thinking Sphinx releases from 3.0.2 or newer, and Rails 5 is supported by TS v3.3.0 onwards

### Using Thinking Sphinx with Unicorn

If you're using Unicorn as your web server, you'll want to ensure the connection pool is cleared after forking.

{% highlight ruby %}
after_fork do |server, worker|
  # Add this to an existing after_fork block if needed.
  ThinkingSphinx::Connection.pool.clear
end
{% endhighlight %}
